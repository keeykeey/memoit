<h2>Object-Oriented Programing</h2>

<h3>Style of Object in JavaScript</h3>
<p>
  <pre><code>var ObjectName  = {
    PropatyName : Propaty (value),
    Method      : Method (function),
}</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    for example...
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <pre><code>var person = {
    height   : 180,
    weight   : 70,
    name     : ken,
    hello    : function(name) {
        console.log("hello " + name + " !")
    }
}</code></pre>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<p>
    Prototypes are mechanism by which JavaScript's Objects inherit features from one another.
</p>
<p>
   Think about coding with the following requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create employee-object which has name-property salary-property, and raiseSalary-method</li>
        <li>Each employee has different name-property and salary-property. So we have to set certain value when we declare employee-object</li>
        <li>Each employee has same raseSalary-method. So we want to use same function for each employee-object.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    To satisfy above requirements, we first define a prototype that has raiseSalary function which each employee shares.
    Second, we define factory function which gets name,salary as arguments to create employee.
    And Finally, inside factory function, we set raiseSalary-method as a prototype of factory function.
<p>
<p>
<ul>
<pre><code>const employeePrototype = {
    raiseSalary : function(percentage){
        this.salary *= 1 + percentage/100;
    }
}<br/>
function createEmployee(name,salary){
    const obj = {name,salary};
    Object.setPrototypeOf(obj,employeePrototype)
    return obj;
}</pre></code>
</ul>
</p>
