<h2>Object-Oriented Programing</h2>

<h3>Style of Object in JavaScript</h3>
<p>
  <pre><code>var ObjectName  = {
    PropatyName : Propaty (value),
    Method      : Method (function),
}</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    for example...
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <pre><code>var person = {
    height   : 180,
    weight   : 70,
    name     : ken,
    hello    : function(name) {
        console.log("hello " + name + " !")
    }
}</code></pre>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<p>
    Prototypes are mechanism by which JavaScript's Objects inherit features from one another.
</p>
<p>
   Think about coding with the following requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create employee-object which has name-property salary-property, and raiseSalary-method</li>
        <li>Each employee has different name-property and salary-property. So we have to set certain value when we declare employee-object</li>
        <li>Each employee has same raseSalary-method. So we want to use same function for each employee-object.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    To satisfy above requirements, we first define a prototype that has raiseSalary function which each employee shares.
    Second, we define factory function which gets name,salary as arguments to create employee.
    And Finally, inside factory function, we set raiseSalary-method as a prototype of factory function.
<p>
<p>
<ul>
<pre><code>const employeePrototype = {
    raiseSalary : function(percentage){
        this.salary *= 1 + percentage/100;
    }
}<br/>
function createEmployee(name,salary){
    const obj = {name,salary};
    Object.setPrototypeOf(obj,employeePrototype)
    return obj;
}</pre></code>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>class</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned above, we have a way to create employee object by using factory function.
    But we have better way to create class object by using "class" as below.
</p>
<ul><pre>class Employee {
    constructor(name, salary) {
        this.name = name,
        this.salary = salary
    }
    raiseSalary(percent) {
        this.salary *= 1 + percent / 100
    }
}
</pre></ul>
<p>
    In above code, "constructor" defines the Employee itself. And then, raiseSalary is appended to the Employee.
    And here are some notes about the grammer of "class" and "constructor".
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"constructor" does not return anything.</li>
        <li>Every "class" can have only one "constructor".</li>
        <li>Unlike in Object literal, we don't have to use  "comma(,)" between methods in class declaration.</l>
    </ul>
</p>
